qunction.js (pronounciation: queue unction)

a library which implements enqueuing functions to be executed in a non blocking manner

foo = new Qunction([arrayOfFunctions]);
foo.add(function/arrayOfFunctions/QunctionInstance[, position])
foo.remove(someOtherFunction/position);
foo.start()
foo.pause()
foo.stop()
foo.rewind()

You can chain methods:
foo.add(bar).add(baz).start()    which is equivalent to
foo.add([bar,baz]).start()       which is equivalent to
new Qunction([bar, baz]).start() which is equivalent to
new Qunction(bar).add(new Qunction(baz)).start()
